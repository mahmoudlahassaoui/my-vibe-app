# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to upgrade the application's data storage from the current JSON file-based system to a PostgreSQL database. This will provide better data persistence, improved performance for larger datasets, support for complex queries, and enhanced security. The upgrade will maintain all existing functionality while providing a more robust foundation for future growth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from JSON file storage to PostgreSQL, so that the application has better data persistence and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically connect to the configured PostgreSQL database.
2. WHEN the PostgreSQL connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to JSON storage and log appropriate warnings.
3. WHEN the application is first run with PostgreSQL configuration THEN the system SHALL automatically create necessary database tables if they don't exist.
4. WHEN database tables are created THEN the system SHALL maintain the same data structure as the current JSON files.
5. WHEN the application is configured for PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for database connection settings.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate existing data from JSON files to PostgreSQL, so that no user data is lost during the upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a migration command is executed THEN the system SHALL transfer all existing user data from JSON files to PostgreSQL.
2. WHEN a migration command is executed THEN the system SHALL transfer all existing message data from JSON files to PostgreSQL.
3. WHEN a migration command is executed THEN the system SHALL transfer all existing session data from JSON files to PostgreSQL.
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity between JSON and PostgreSQL.
5. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL roll back any changes and maintain the original JSON data.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to maintain the same API and functionality, so that the database change is transparent to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is upgraded THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing application functionality.
2. WHEN users register, login, or logout THEN the system SHALL perform these operations using PostgreSQL instead of JSON files.
3. WHEN users submit contact messages THEN the system SHALL store these in PostgreSQL instead of JSON files.
4. WHEN the application displays message counts or lists THEN the system SHALL retrieve this data from PostgreSQL.
5. WHEN sessions are created or validated THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL for storage and retrieval.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle database operations securely and efficiently, so that performance is optimized and data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.
2. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling for efficiency.
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL maintain the same level of encryption/hashing as the current implementation.
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and logging.
5. WHEN the application performs database operations THEN the system SHALL optimize queries for performance.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to maintain backward compatibility, so that it can run with either storage method based on configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is configured to use JSON storage THEN the system SHALL function exactly as before.
2. WHEN the application is configured to use PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL use the database for all data operations.
3. WHEN the storage method is changed in configuration THEN the system SHALL not require code changes elsewhere in the application.
4. WHEN the application is deployed in Docker THEN the system SHALL support easy configuration of either storage method.
5. IF the PostgreSQL connection is lost during operation THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with appropriate backoff strategy.
